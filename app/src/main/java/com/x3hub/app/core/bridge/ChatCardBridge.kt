/**
 * Phase 2 Step 2c.3 — cross-Activity bridge for the unipanel
 * mini-card stack.
 *
 * The chat conversation state lives in visionclaw's MainViewModel
 * (app module). The tapbrowser overlay (this module) needs to
 * render the last few exchanges as compact mini cards over the
 * WebView. The two Activities run in the same process but are in
 * different modules and different Activities, so a process-local
 * singleton is the lightest-weight way to ferry the state across:
 * no Binder, no Intent, no Service.
 *
 * The pattern matches [com.TapLink.app.media.BrowserFrameHolder],
 * which Step 1 used to bridge the WebView reference into Gemini's
 * vision tool. Same idea: thread-safe holder, weak listeners,
 * pushers don't need to know what (if anything) is observing.
 *
 * Threading: state writes are atomic. Listeners fire on the
 * publisher's thread — UI consumers must hop to main themselves
 * (the tapbrowser MainActivity uses uiHandler.post).
 *
 * The bridge does NOT cap the list size. visionclaw already trims
 * its chat history to MAX_ASSISTANT_CHAT_CARDS before publishing,
 * and the consumer renders only the N most-recent entries.
