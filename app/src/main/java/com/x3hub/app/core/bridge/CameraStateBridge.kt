/**
 * Phase 2 Step 2c.4 — cross-Activity bridge for the unipanel camera
 * status chip.
 *
 * visionclaw's MainActivity already observes
 * [viewModel.voiceAssistantActive] to drive the on-screen camera
 * column. We mirror that boolean into this process-local singleton
 * so the tapbrowser overlay can render a small "Cam" indicator in
 * the top-right corner when Gemini Live is actively watching.
 *
 * Same pattern as [ChatCardBridge] and
 * [com.TapLink.app.media.BrowserFrameHolder] — Binder-free,
 * thread-safe state, listener API.
 *
 * Why state-only (no live frames): a full mirrored TextureView
 * would require extending the Camera2 session to write to two
 * SurfaceTextures, which is invasive. The chip gives the user
 * the "yes Gemini can see me right now" feedback without that
 * complexity. Step 2c.4 v2 can upgrade to a live preview later
 * if needed.
